		<p>Hi. My name is Andy Wyllie. I was born in Southern California, but was raised in Utah. I went to school at the University of Utah and graduated with a degree in environmental geology in 2017. My childhood dream was to be an astronaut. That didn't materialize(yet), but the passion for exploration has remained the same. That is what attracted me to geology, and also what attracts me to web development. Creating something that is currently unknown is just as exciting to me as exploring something unknown. I'm currently located in Ubud, Bali working on my web development skills and some side projects. Below are a couple photos of my time here.

<p>As a student at the University of Utah, I studied geology. During this time, I had an internship at the Natural History Museum of Utah. Here I helped managed the Excel databases of more than 30,000 specimens. I learned proper lab procedure as a scientist, field testing, and critical thinking. I focused on environmental courses in school so my geologic knowledge pertains more to the earth as we know it know, instead of that of the past.
	</p>
	<p>
I decided to learn web development alongside geology because I liked the process of creation more than research in most cases. I started with some YouTube tutorials on building a simple HTML webpage and just went from there. 
	<br>
I am comfortable with HTML/CSS, CSS animations, JavaScript, Node, Express, mySQL, Bootstrap, SemanticUI, and Adobe Photoshop.  
				</p>
				<h1 class="highlight">Experience</h1><div class="addBorderBottom"></div>
<p>
Before attending the University of Utah in 2013, I ventured off to Zhenjiang, China to teach English. I taught at a high school as well as a preschool. As you can imagine, each came with their own set of challenges. Above all else, I learned the value of communication and knowing your audience. Because I was in charge of all the course material, I got my first real taste of self-reliance in the workplace. Since then, every job I've worked has had elements that require me to do things on my own, and I've come to enjoy that.
			</p>
			<p>
As mentioned above, my main job in college was an internship at the Natural History Museum of Utah in the paleontology department. The museum provided a great amount of job duties. I cataloged micropaleontology specimens(teeth, claws, and vertebraes of very small creatures), educated the public during special events, rock-climbed to dig sites, and shuffled fossils in collection so they could be used by the exhibits. 
			<p>
During my first year in college, I donated plasma to pay the bills that the museum internship didn't cover. After that first year, I took a 2nd job as a tour guide for SLC Bike Taxi. This job did more for my people skills than all my life experience combined had before. I thrived as a salesman and tour guide, selling people on hour long rides around Salt Lake City, and then delivering a tour experience that lived up to how I presented it. This was my primary source of income for more than 2 years, and I still take some shifts when I have extra free time.		
			</p>
I got an entrepreneurial bug shortly after that job, and have opened 2 businesses since then. 1 is still in operation now. That business is a guesthouse located in downtown Salt Lake City. I found a lot of my clients on the bike taxi wanted somewhere to stay downtown that wasn't a hotel. I did some research on zoning laws and the basics of the hospitality industry. I rented a 3 bedroom apartment in downtown Salt Lake City and opened Tour Guide Guesthouse shortly after. Since 2016, I've hosted over 250 unique guests. 			
			</p>				<h1 class="highlight">Ideal Roles</h1><div class="addBorderBottom"></div>
				<p>
				Ideally, I'd like to work for an ambitious startup. I'm very passionate about my own growth, and would like to be a part of a team with the same energy. 
				<br>
I would thrive in a role that requires an equal amount of people skills and web development skills. I'm currently looking for a position in software implementation or as a front-end developer, but I'm open to anything if you think I'd be a good fit. Feel free to reach out to me!

	<h3>YelpCamp Full Stack Project</h3>
	<p>
	YelpCamp is a full-stack project using node, express, and mongo to host user created campsites. Some of it's features are: creating users using passport, use of google maps API to choose the location of the campground, RESTFUL convention for campgrounds and comments routes, and a landing page that utilizes beautiful background images.

	<h3>Custom HTML5 video player</h3>
	<p>
	HTML5 has default video controls built into the video element. Frankly, those are ugly. This project was done as an exercise to understand some of the properties of the video element. The bottom sliders adjust the volume and speed of the video, and the progress bar can be clicked to move around the video(like YouTube).

	<h3>Type Ahead API Search</h3>
	<p>
	The type ahead page makes an HTTP request to a cities JSON file of 1000 cities and associated data. This happens on each keypress, so you can imagine the performance would be poor. To combat this, only the cities matching the search terms are returned. A span that highlights those matching search terms is placed on each expression to show users where the their search is matched.
